> Database application to manage and view movie viewings at theaters, created as the result of a semester-long group project for CS 4400: Intro to Database Systems with Professor Mark Moss. The application is composed of a PostgreSQL persistence layer, a Python Flask application layer, and a React-powered dashboard.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### üêç Backend Services

To run and develop the backend services locally, first make sure [Docker Compose is installed](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) and then run:

```console
```

### üñ• Frontend App

To run and develop the frontend services locally, first ensure that both [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and a package manager of your choice (either [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) or [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)) are installed. Then, simply run:

```console
cd app
yarn install
```

to download the neccessary dependencies (make sure to run `npm install` if you are using npm).

#### üì° Development Server

Because the web application is built with [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/) at its core, there are two options to preview the app while developing: a **hot reload-enabled development server** *(recommended)* and a **minified app bundle**.

##### Hot-reload-enabled

```console
yarn start
```

##### Minified app bundle

```console
yarn build
yarn serve
```

## üõ† Tooling

- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) - Used to automatically deploy & generate previews for branches and pull requests. Deploy status is available at [the Deploy page](https://app.netlify.com/sites/cinema-system/deploys)
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) / [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) - Used to enforce consistent code style across the frontend codebase & to catch errors
- [Flake8](http://flake8.pycqa.org/) - Used to enforce consistent code style across the backend codebase & to catch errors
- [UptimeRobot](https://uptimerobot.com/) - Used to track uptime and notify upon outage for [the website and the API](https://status.cinema-system.ga/)
- [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/) - Used to host both the [application layer image](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/jazevedo6/cinema-system-api) and the [persistence layer image](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/jazevedo6/cinema-system-db)
- [Github Actions](https://github.com/jazevedo6/cinema-system/actions) - Used to automatically build & lint both the front and back ends, as well as to push the backend containers to DockerHub
