# Frontend Source

This directory contains the source code that the React-powered dashboard is powered by.

## ðŸš€ Running

To get started, run:

```
yarn install
yarn start
```
## ðŸŽ¨ Code Style

The frontend uses [eslint](https://eslint.org/) and [prettier](https://prettier.io/) to enforce JavaScript code style across the codebase. To run the linter locally, run:

```console
yarn run lint
```

## ðŸ–¥ Hosting

In the final project, the frontend is hosted by [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), which provides free hosting and continuous deployment for pushes/pull requests.
