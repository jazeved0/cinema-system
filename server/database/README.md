# PostgreSQL Database Seed

This folder contains all of the SQL files needed to seed the data persistence container needed for the full stack application. It also contains the `Dockerfile` used to define the persistence container image.

> Note that these files are different from those in `/mysql`. They have been edited to accommodate the differing syntax, but should remain functionally equivalent *(except for the fact that all of the stored procedures have been implemented in Python ORM instead of SQL)*.
